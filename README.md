#  3D Knowledge Graph

This knowledge graph is a 3D presentation of wikidata items associated with searchwords.
It uses Non-negative Matrix factorization (NNMF) to extract 10 topics with 5 words from the first 100 searchresults from semanticscholar
related to the keyword. The force-graph is based on https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph

## TODO

- customize topic modelling algorithms 

- expand another network after clicking on a node
